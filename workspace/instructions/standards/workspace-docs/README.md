# Workspace Documentation Standard

This directory contains the versioned documentation and agent-process standard
for repositories that adopt this workspace structure.

The standard defines:

- required project documentation files & root container structure (`workspace/agents/`, `workspace/instructions/`, `workspace/specs/`, `workspace/docs/`, `workspace/company/`)
- root policy and token rules (`AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`)
- spec-driven development states and transitions
- primary-feature grouping and a canonical spec status-rationale catalog
- generated versus static documentation boundaries
- durable agent memory storage rules
- audit criteria and migration guidance for agents
  ([`AGENT_MIGRATION.md`](./AGENT_MIGRATION.md))

## Current Versions

- `latest` points to `v7.0.0` (newest available version).
- `default` points to `v7.0.0` (recommended stable version).
- `v7.0.0` is the SDLC redesign release: verified main merge defines done,
  blocked specs preserve resume state, and modular iteration precedes full final
  verification. Deployment/publication is separate. Both default and latest select v7.
- `v6.0.0` source was released through main; its acceptance work remains open.
  Preserve its package unchanged. The release ledger records actual events.
- `v4.0.0` / `v3.0.0` / `v2.1.0` / `v2.0.0` / `v1.2.0` /
  `v1.1.0` / `v1.0.0` legacy
  versions are preserved for backward compatibility.

Projects should pin to a concrete version when reproducibility matters:

```text
workspace-docs@7.0.0
```

Projects may use `workspace-docs@default` while adopting the shared process.

## Adoption & Structural Separation Model

Generated or synchronized agent context must live inside clear markers:

```md
<!-- AGENT-CONTEXT:START workspace-docs@7.0.0 -->
<!-- Generated content. Manual edits may be overwritten. -->
<!-- AGENT-CONTEXT:END -->
```

Manual project rules must stay outside generated blocks.

Agents performing a first-time adoption, version update, or structural repair
must start with the [Agent Migration Guide](./AGENT_MIGRATION.md), then apply the
target version's migration notes and audit checklist.

Version 5.0 preserves feature grouping, the root status catalog, and memory
impact, and adds an explicit test state. Specifications move from development
to test only after shared test integration and from test to done only after
production release. Conventional branches are `develop` and `main`, but
repositories may document equivalents.

The preserved version 6.0 contract requires each concurrent
mutating agent to use a dedicated linked worktree plus a repository-visible WIP
record. Worktrees are detached by default. Version 6 retains direct branch requests;
version 7 authorizes ordinary task branches through the task request.

When the repository includes the
[`adopt-workspace-structure` skill](../../skills/adopt-workspace-structure/SKILL.md),
invoke it to manage this workflow from discovery through validated completion.
