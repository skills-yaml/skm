# Agent Memory

This directory stores durable project memory for the `skm` repository.

It follows `workspace-docs@5.0.0` from
`workspace/instructions/standards/workspace-docs`.

- Do not store secrets, credentials, tokens, or transient scratch notes.
- Prefer append-only updates.
- Mark obsolete entries as superseded instead of deleting them.

- `facts.md`: stable project facts that are expensive to rediscover.
- `preferences.md`: human or team preferences that affect future work.
- `open-questions.md`: unresolved questions.
- `changelog.md`: append-only log of memory updates.
