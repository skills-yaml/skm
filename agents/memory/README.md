# Agent Memory

This directory stores durable project memory for the `skm` repository.

It follows `workspace-docs@1.0.0` from `/home/e/work/projects/agents/docs/standards/workspace-docs/v1.0.0/`.

- Do not store secrets, credentials, tokens, or transient scratch notes.
- Prefer append-only updates.
- Mark obsolete entries as superseded instead of deleting them.

- `open-questions.md`: unresolved questions.
